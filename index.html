                <h3>Zero Interest (0%) Goods/Services Based Loans</h3>
                <p>Instead of getting High interest rate Short term loans to 
                sort out unforeseen financial challenges, which essentially 
                means paying for goods/services, you can through Eziit have 
                access to goods/services and pay back within 30 days or any agreed
                upon period. This will make you Save as you pay exactly the amount 
                for the goods/services gotten, nothing more, no interest to be paid.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="box-services">
                <h2>02</h2>
                <h3>Point of Sale Based Transactions</h3>
                <p>Pay for goods and services with your eziit App 
                 at the point of sale. You can either use the employer or Merchant 
                 approved amount (s). Just check if the shop/merchant is on your approved 
                 merchants list and you are good to go. The employer approved amount 
                 is paid through payroll while the merchant approved amount directly 
                 to the merchant by the account holder subject to the agreed unpo period</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="box-services">
                <h2>03</h2>
                <h3>Reputaion Collateral Based Purchases</h3>
                <p>Get access to goods/services from a merchant who knows you personally
                 or has approved a certain amount for you based on your good reputaion with 
                 them or other merchants. The key here is that your good reputaion acts as 
                 collateral to trust that you will pay within the agreed upon period.</p>
                
            </div>

                <h2>04</h2>
                <h3>Pay for Others</h3>
                <p>You can create a voucher for a certain amount and send to a third party 
                to transact in any shop or with any merchant on your approved merchant list. The third 
                party can be anywhere in the world and the voucher will still work as long 
                as the voucher is presented to a shop or establishment on your approved merchnat list.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="box-services">
                <h2>05</h2>
                <h3>Group Purchases</h3>
                <p>You can create a group, add or invite others with eziit accounts and 
                contribute for a payment. This can be used to contribute towards school 
                fees for a sibling, contibute for a family event or settle any shared 
                expenses.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="box-services">
                <h2>06</h2>
                <h3>Build Reputation Collateral</h3>
                <p>Each time you use eziit to pay for goods/services, and pay back within 
                the agreed upon period, a record of this is kept and translated into reputaion 
                collateral to give you more access to other merchants who will depend on this 
                reputation to give you access to their goods/services. Therefore, each good 
                act on eziit gives you more liverage in the eziit trust based community. 
                This is because high cost future payment based business transactions are usually 
                due to the related risk management costs hence if you are a low risk, then you should 
                not pay for high risk managements costs and benefit from your good reputation.</p>
