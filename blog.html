            <h2><a name="debtProblem">The Short Term Debt Problem and the Eziit Solution</a></h2>
            <p>The continuous uptake of short-term consumer credit products whereby money is 
            borrowed today and is paid back usually within one month with interest, as is the case with payday 
            loans, salary advances, soft loans or whatever they are called for whatever reason, 
            indicates strong market demand. This could be attributed to consumers not having 
            alternatives when faced with short term finance needs, covinience or any other good 
            reasons. However, such credit facilities are synonymous with high interest rates and 
            evidence suggesting such credit leads to adverse consumer outcomes such as being trapped 
            in debt traps and consumer financial distress due to high interest rates is prominent.<br>
            <br>Eziit acknowleges that these high interest rates 
            are becuase of real and perceived default risk considerations. Therefore, Eziit uses an integrated approach to 
            develop a zero Interest (0%) Rate Model using an advanced Four-tier <a href="eziitConcept.html">Ezitt Peer-to-Peer 
            Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS)</a> to create a low risk trust based community centered 
            on addressing information mismatch between partys in a transaction so that each party 
            is prevented from witholding information which might be important for the other party to form 
            an informed decsion (asymmetry of information). This is because the information constraint is 
            the main cause of <a href="http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/6641" target="_blank">risk 
            consequently high interest rates in short term credit transactions</a>.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="blog_col">
                    <h3>Why High Interest Rates are Charged on Short Term Loans</h3>
                    <p>An Interest Rate is usually composed of four (04) elements which dictate whether 
                    the rate is high or low and these are,<br> <br>1. Profit,<br> 2. Provision for Non-Performing 
                    Loans (NPL),<br> 3. Overheads (Outreach, Processing and General adminstrative costs),
                    and <br>4. Cost of Funds used by the lender. <br><br>In a high risk environment, a bigger 
                    provision for NPLs and more outreach, processing and other administrative 
                    activities which all cost money will have to be undertaken making the interest high. 
                    Therefore, in a low risk environment, very little is spent on these activties making 
                    the overall interest rate low. What Eziit does using the Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer 
                    Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS) is to eradicate all these activties hence 
                    making a totally Zero Interest (0%)Rate for short term loans possible.
                    <br>

                <div class="blog_col">
                    <h3>How Bad Debt affects everyone including those who don't Borrow</h3>
                    <p>The preceeding section has indicated that high interest rates are usually 
                    due to high risk management activties such as provision for NPLs, processing,
                    outreach and administrative activities which cost money. <br> <br>Therefore, since 
                    risk is essentially a perception issue, if others getting loans are defaulting 
                    , the general risk perception of that society increases hence ultimately 
                    affecting the overall risk and this is what leads to everyone being affected
                    because a component of the overal risk is usually considered as a whole (Systematic Risk)
                    and factored in most products hence everyone being affected. <br><br>The irony is that there are 
                    fairly good records of defaults hence affecting the risk perception but alot 
                    of good practice goes unnoticed, especailly in the informal sector. Eziit 
                    through the Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Aprroval System (EPPVAS)
                    ensures both are done hence benefiting all stakeholders within the Eziit community.</p>

                    <h3>How Everyone can Benefit frorm Zero Interest (0%) Short Term Loans</h3>
                    <p>Eziit benefits everyone in the Eziit Community because it is a Trust based Mutual 
                    benefit community which enables <a href="eziitConcept.html" class="stakeholders">Individuals</a> to 
                    use Reputation as collateral for Zero interest (0%) 
                    short term loans, guarantees <a href="eziitConcept.html" class="stakeholders">Employers</a> 
                    increased productivity through stress free employees by increasing their net salaries at 
                    no extra cost to the employer, increases sales volume/profitability for <a href="eziitConcept.html"

                    <br> The most important thing with eziit is that it pursues a sustainable solution 
                    because it focuses on mutual benefits  which are protected by the Four-tier Eziit 
                    Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS).</p>

            <h2><a name="ezzitGeneral">Eziit General Zero Interest (0%) Short Term Loans Concept</a></h2>
            <p>The Eziit general Zero Interest (0%) Short term loans idea is anchored on unlocking the 
            potential benefits embeded in short term consumer finance for Individuals, Employers of 
            those who use short term finance, Merchants from whom users of short term finance 
            buy goods/services from and Financial ainstitutions who either supply short term finance 
            or could influence it, for mutual gain. The general premise is that the adverse effects 
            of short term finance tend to ultimately affect all these stakeholders hence in the 
            best interest of all these to be part of the solution.<br>
            
            <br>These general adverse effects, which are intertwined among others range from,
            Individuals being trapped in debt traps, getting financially distress hence their productivity at 
            work going down and the employer losing out. Being in a dept trap due to paying high 
            interest on short term financing could mean having low take home salary and force 
            individuals to start demanding for salary increments, not becuase the current salry was 
            low but because most was being used to pay off high interest loans and this would lead to 
            the employer losing out by increasing salaries or low productivity from a demotivated workforce.<br>
            <br>On the part of Merchnats, a reduced net income for individuals means reduced purchasing 
            power which could lead to buying less and less from the Merchants leading to relatively low sales 
            volumes and profitability. In the case of Financial Institutions, most of their products 
            are risk sensitive hence a general rise in the risk profile of individuals would make 
            their products more expensive and end up initiating more financial related problems to the 
            detriment of all stakeholders.<br>

            <br>It is against this background that Eziit using the Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer 
            Vetting and Approval system (EPPVAS) creates  a platform on which the need for actual 
            money which is costly because of considerations for Profit, NPLs, Administrative costs 
            and cost of money is erradicated by giving access to goods/services to individuals 
            through the <a href="#productLoans">Eziit Product based short term loans</a>.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="blog_col">
                    <h3><a name="productLoans">Eziit Product Based Short Term Loans</a></h3>
                    <p>Individuals who use short term consumer finance are never interested in the money 
                    they get and have to pay back with interest but the goods/services 
                    they can pay for using that money. If it was possible, a cheaper option 
                    would be to directly get the goods/services and pay at their payday. 
                    However, the trust between individuals and merchants is too low for such 
                    to happen, consequently they have to borrow money and immediatelly pay for goods/services. 
                    Therefore, the interest they pay back becomes the price for lack of trust
                    and looking at statistics of how the short term consumer credit space has 
                    been growing in billions of dollars, that is too high a price to pay for 
                    lack of trust, especially if an alternative existed. <br>
                    <br>Eziit provises that alternative by creating a <a href="#trustCommunity">
                    Eziit Trust based community</a> in which Merchants could
                    give access to their goods/services to individuals so that the money they 
                    would have instead paid out in the form of interest could continue 
                    circulating amongst themselves for mutual gain. This development which Eziit
                    makes possible through its Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval 
                    Systme (EPPVAS) is what is refered to as Zero Interest (0%) Product or Goods/services 
                    Based short term Loans.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="blog_col">
                    <h3><a name="trustCommunity">Eziit Tust Based Communities</a></h3>
                    <p>This basically refers to the Platform Eziit provides using the Four-tier Eziit 
                    Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS) on which proper vetting is done 
                    through a combination of advance technology and humans to create a secure and efficient 
                    system which enables individuals and Merchants not to lose out on extra purchaing power 
                    or profitability due to hight cost short term loans.<br>
                    <br> 
                    In view of the foregoing, Eziit ensures that Trust is created and most importantly 
                    sustained through real time updates on all stakeholders so they can make informed decisions. 
                    This maintaining of trust through monitored good business practices then develops into a 
                    Reputaion of good business practice which can then be used as Collateral 
                    (<a href="#reputationCollateral">Reputation Collateral</a>) within the platform
                    to have access to more opportunities to do business with more Eziit stakeholders.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="blog_col">
                    <h3><a name="reputationCollateral">Reputaion Collateral</a></h3>
                    <p>Reputation Collateral simply means someone has a treceable good business practice 
                    of timely paying for things gotten on credit and not defaulting on busniess 
                    agreements hence being classified as a low risk party. This then is intented 
                    to attest to the good business practices of such a party and encourage others 
                    to do business with them or extend favourable credit faciilities without having to 
                    spend on vetting or other administrative costs to ensure they honor up to whatever 
                    they have pledged to do.<br>
                    <br> Eziit then ensures this Reputation Collateral is maintained by giving 
                    access to stakeholders to upadate on the conduct of the Party in question through the 
                    Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS). This then 
                    compels Eziit users to good business practices as doing anything contrary 
                    could lead to erroding the Reputation Collateral and miss out on favourable business 
                    deals for them or could even be removed from the platform, a record kept forever and made 
                    available to all who inquire on doing business with them.</p>
