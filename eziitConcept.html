<section class="eziitBuildingBlocks">
    <h1><a name="howWeCanHelp"></a>How We Are Able To Help</h1>
    <h6> The high interest rates on short term loans are esssentially because of 
    the high risk involved in transacting between Individuals, Employers,
    Merchants and Financial Institutions. Eziit creates an 
    environment in which this risk is eliminated and/or reduced through establishing
    Trust, enabling Collaborataion and all this anchored on Mutual Benefit for 
    all at no additional cost to any of them, aidded by the secure Four-tier <a href="#eppvas">Eziit Peer-to-Peer 
    Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS)</a>.</h6>

            <div class="layer">
                <h3>Trust</h3>
            </div>
            <h4>Trust</h4>
            <p>The key influencer of cost in most short term 
            future payment based transcations is lack of 
            trust between the partys involved, which esssentially 
            should be Individual buyers and Merchants. This forces 
            both partys to engage in creditworthy or product reliability 
            screening activities (which can be costly depending on the 
            levels of lack of trust) to mitigate the possible risks such 
            as default or substandard deliverables hence 
             making the whole transaction more costly for both partys. 
             However, Eziit creates a community in which trust is created and 
             sustained consequently reducing on activities needed to 
             maintain the respective relationship. This leads to low 
             transaction costs hence both partys and/or other connected 
             stakeholder such us employers and Financial Institutions 
             if needed, gaining. This is made possible through the mandatory 
             Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval System (EPPVAS) which creates
            reputation Collateral and compels good bevahour in fear of erroding 
            the reputaion collateral, leading to being flagged as a high risk 
            party to others both within and outside the Eziit Community.</p>

                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            </div>
            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            <p>Collaboration between and amongst stakeholders in any 
            sector is usually benefial to all stakeholders if feasible.
            However, it is usually very difficult to collaborte in numbers
            big enough to unlock the full potential of such collaboration.
            This is usually due to conflicting interests and not having 
            means to integrate all such interests. Eziit provides such 
            integration of interests through creating a trust based community
            hence unlocks the mutual benefit embeded in collaboration, 
            especially beyond physical lines.This collaboration created and 
            sustained the mandatory Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and 
            Approval System (EPPVAS).</p>

                <h3>Mutual Benefit</h3>
            </div>
            <h4>Mutual Benefit</h4>
            <p>Mutual Benefits essentially speaks to sustainability.
            This is why Eziit is a mutual benefit centric 
            platform which is created through establishing 
            a trust based collaborative community as a means to 
            creating sustainanble value for stakeholders, which in 
            this case is Individuals, Employers , Merchants and 
            Financial Institutions. This is ensured through the mandatory 
            Four-tier Eziit Peer-to-Peer Vetting and Approval System 
            (EPPVAS) which enables each stakeholder to endorse 
            and monitor its interests while protecting those of others. 
            EPPVAAS compels all in the Eziit community as it gives powers to
            add or reduce other's reputaion collateral based on how they 
            rate them on each tranaction.</p>

            (EPPVAS) highlights how multifaceted the risk management system used on 
            Eziit is, to ensure trust is established and most importantly, sustained.
            Therefore, the Four-tier phrase discribes the merging of technology and 
            humans in terms of human stakeholders involved in the vetting process. 
            This integration includes,<br>
            <br>1. The Individual account holder,<br>
            <br>2. The merchant,<br>
            <br>3.  Either the employer, Financial institution or both, and<br>
            <br>4. The Eziit system,<br>
            <br>The basic premise is to integrate technology and humans to achieve the most 
            secure and efficient security system. This is because technology on its own can be too 
            rigid hence not efficient while humans also on their own might end up missing out 
            on certain things hence not secure enough. However, a combination of the two (02) 
            brings about compliments which properly blend together secureness and efficiency 
            to the benefit of the whole system.</p>
