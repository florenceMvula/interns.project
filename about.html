            <h3><a name="ourTeam"></a>Our Team</h3>
            <p>Eziit is an initiative birthed out of a team of graduates with a strong 
            desire to enhance the wellbeing of people when faced with unforeseen short 
            term financial needs while not having any adverse effects on other key 
            stakeholders in this space, such as Employers, Merchants and 
            Financial Institutions.  It's a product of a <a href="http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/6641" target="_blank">Masters and Ph.D thesis</a> for one 
            of the founding members of staff, on short term consumer credit, its good aspects
            such as being conviniet and easily acessible while also considering adverse effects such as 
            being associated with high interest rates which  mostly led to financial distress
            in consumers. The studies where conducted with and from Whence Limited which is a
            start-up based in Lusaka, Zambia. Whence Limited through it's financial services 
            business unit has been operating as a lending institution since 2014. <br> 
            <br>
            Whence Limited was founded by graduates from <a href="https://www.unza.zm/" target="_blank">The University of Zambia (UNZA)</a>, <a href="https://www.cbu.ac.zm/" target="_blank">The 
            Copperbelt University(CBU)</a>,<a href="https://zcas.ac.zm/zcas-professional/" target="_blank">The Zambia Centre for Accountancy Studies (ZCAS)</a> and other institutions of 
            higher learning with the main goal of creating opportunities for youths
            while pursuing mutual benefit solutions to challenges in local communities
            and other parts of the world.Therefore, the Eziit team is composed of 
            Multidisciplinary University graduates looking for sustainable soulutions 
            for stakeholders in respective industries for mutual benefit.</p>

            <h3><a name="ourStory"></a>Our Story</h3>
            <p> After operating in the consumer Short term loans space since 2014, we 
            observed that inasmuch as <a href="http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/6641" target="_blank">short term consumer credit</a> was good and helpful, 
            its <a href="http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/6641" target="_blank">undesirable tendencies of trapping consumers in perpertual debt traps</a> if not properly
             used did a lot of damage to society as a whole. This was because an 
             individual in a debt trap ended up having a trickle down effect on other 
             stakeholders such as employers, Merchants and Financial Institutions. The 
             observation was that when an individual gets trapped in a debt trap, it led 
             to them being financially stressed hence affecting their productivity at work, 
             this made the employer to lose out. <br>
             <br>
            In the case of Merchants, high interest rates led to a reduction in desposable 
            income hence reducing how much they could buy from producers of goods and services, 
            once again having a negative effect on the respective merchants in terms of reduced sales volume. On the 
             part of Financial institutions, the risk of doing business with such 
             individuals went up hence could only do so at unfavorable conditions. 
             It was this observation which led to the conclusion that debt was leading 
             to all stakeholders losing hence prompting the pursuit for a better way of 
             doing things. This better way was established to be anchored on reducing 
             the risk of doing business and the creation of a Trust based community through 
             which members could coordinate to lower the risk of default hence leading 
            to better conditions with regards to consumer short term loans to the benefit
            all stakeholders.
            
                 </p>

            <h3><a name="ourIdea"></a>Our Idea & Why it Could be important to you</h3>
            <p>The basic premise of eziit is to add a strategic
            twist to the conventional understanding of short term consumer debt based 
            purchase transactions and how they are financed in light of the 
            <a href="http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/6641" target="_blank">shortcomings 
            of the current short term financing options</a> such as the 
            extremely expensive high interest payday loans. Therefore, the objective is to 
            maintain the advantages of short term financing such as ability to 
            quickly fill up budget shortfalls or deal with unforeseen financial 
            constraints whilst totally exterminating the shortcomings such as 
            being associated with extremely high interest rates by introducing by 
            managing the risk so as to have “Zero interest” short term product or 
            service based loans or any type of low cost short term financing while 
            creating value for all key stakeholders.<br>
            
            <br>This has since been done by eziit through tinkering with the constituents
            of an interest rate to which each a cost is attached hence the usual exorbitant resultant 
            interest rate. Meanwhile, product/Service based loans are  are able to 
            unlock the value of short term consumer credit because they are cashless 
            loans which only give borrowers access to whatever they would have 
            otherwise used cash to pay for. The basic premise being that if the 
            need for actual cash is removed from the purchase transaction, 
            such a development would present an opportunity to entirely remove 
            the need for interest to be paid on short term loans hence solving 
            the excessively high interest problem on short term financing and
            unlocking value for key stakeholders, starting with individual consumers,
             employers, merchants and financial institutions. <br>
            <br>
             In view of the foregoing, if you are an employer and the challenge is getting 
             or giving more value to financially stressed members of staff due to being trapped
            in debt but at no extra cost to you, you could be a merchant seeking profitability 
            and/or market growth at no extra cost or maybe just a consumer looking to get more 
            value from income, or a financial institution lookingfor low risk income streams at 
            no extra cost, then you can “Easy Off” such challenges through eziit. <br>
            <br>
             Principally, eziit is an online platform through which organizations which employ 
             people<a href="eziitConcept.html" class="stakeholders">(Employers)</a>, those who 
             produce goods or services<a href="eziitConcept.html" 
             class="stakeholders">(Merchants)</a>, those who buy 
             goods and services <a href="eziitConcept.html" class="stakeholders">(Individuals)</a> and 
             <a href="eziitConcept.html" class="stakeholders">Financial Institutions</a> ( banks, insurance companies,
             pension funds, etc) or any similar institutions capable of underwriting purchase 
             transactions are enabled to do business on a platform on which their interests are 
             integrated for mutual benefit. Eziit in this case basically integrates operations 
             to optimize short term purchase transactions much to the shared benefits of employers, 
             Merchants, Consumers and financial institutions.The transactions under consideration 
             are essentially “Trust Based Transactions” were a payment for a product/service 
             or the delivery of a product/service is to be done at a future date though in the short term.
